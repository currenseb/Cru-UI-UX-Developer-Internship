# Cru-UI-UX-Developer-Internship
A portfolio of most of my work as a UI/UX Developer Intern at Cru headquarters during Summer 2025. This repository contains the high-fidelity mockups developed based on meetings with backend engineers and insights from five user interviews, following Nielsen's usability heuristics. A link to the public Cru repository, which includes the Ruby on Rails implementation, is also provided.
